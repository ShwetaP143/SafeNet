    Answer: @GeneratedValue is used to specify the strategy for generating primary key values.

26. Explain the difference between get() and load() methods in Hibernate.
    Answer: The get() method returns the real object and executes the query immediately, while the load() method returns a proxy and loads the data only when needed.

27. What is the purpose of the @OneToMany annotation in Hibernate?
    Answer: The @OneToMany annotation is used to define a one-to-many relationship between two entities.

28. How do you handle many-to-many relationships in Hibernate?
    Answer: Many-to-many relationships can be handled using the @ManyToMany annotation along with the use of a join table.

29. What is the purpose of the Hibernate Template?
    Answer: Hibernate Template is used to handle the Hibernate Session and provide a simplified API for data access operations.

30. Explain the purpose of the merge() method in Hibernate.
    Answer: The merge() method is used to copy the state of a detached object into a persistent object with the same identifier.

31. How do you handle bi-directional associations in Hibernate?
    Answer: Bi-directional associations can be handled by using appropriate annotations like @ManyToOne, @OneToMany, @OneToOne, or @ManyToMany.
